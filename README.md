# Socialbot
This is a chatbot which can be set to any social media platform and can carry out basic functions of a chatbot and can be personalised accordingly. 
This doesn't require any training and neither requires GPU.
Wbot.py is the file which has the modules and the respective functions required for the chatbot.
Wtrainer.py is the file which has the questions and answers that you want your bot to respond to in your absence.
Remaining are the images required for the open CV modulue to detect the particular spots to carry out the process.
I will be upgrading this chatbot in future which will have new and exciting features :-)
